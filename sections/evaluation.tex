\section{Evaluation of Progress and Evolution of Underpinning Ideas} % (fold)
\label{sec:evaluation}

The proposed research project involves the introduction of new software development processes to an organization. This process is meant to be exploratory and evolution in the way that the process occurs is encouraged. This also applies to the way that progress is measured. 

At the heart of this process is people, whose reactions to the introduction of new processes and new knowledge will determine how the project evolves further.
The initial stages of the research project, conducting empirical usability testing, will provide valuable insight into the preconceptions that the research design builds on.

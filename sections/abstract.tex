\begin{abstract}
Web development often ignores accessibility, inadvertently or through negligence. Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit of demanding rich content and user experiences, planning and development often fails to develop for access methods that lie beyond the ideal prototypical user. This paper proposes a research project for a development methodology for developing and auditing rich web applications, driven by accumulated domain knowledge and related to developers' own frame of reference.

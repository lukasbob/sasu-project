The central problem that the proposed research seeks to address is the cognitive divide between developers that develop for the web, and users with disabilities. In broadly generalizing terms, developers know that disabled users exist, and they have vague notions of these users using exotic mechanisms to use computers. However, these users represent an unknowable otherness that is far removed developers' usual frame of reference.

In order to bridge this gap, an approach other than the accessibility audit is necessary. As we will see, organizational drivers for implementing accessibility are primarily economic and social, and among the main social motivations is personal experience by key personalities within organizations. So in some cases, empathy and understanding is sufficient to drive organizational change. 

This leads us to pose the broader question: \\

\textbf{Is a humanist approach, predicated on embedding empathy and understanding barriers to accessibility, a viable foundation for developing auditing tools to test web accessibility?}\\

The scope of the research question is reduced to a single professional setting; an organization that has web accessibility as one of its primary business domains. This enables us some latitude to dedicate substantial effort to mapping the domain thoroughly.

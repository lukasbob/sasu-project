\caption{Artefact generation forms the backbone of the development process. They act as a ubiquitous language between users, that represent the variability of the domain, and the development team. They also provide the core of the tool documentation, providing a \emph{rationale} for reported errors. Standards documents contribute to informing and codifying user stories, but their role is peripheral.}
